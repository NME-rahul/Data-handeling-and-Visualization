Types of Data
1. Quantative data
a. Discrete data	b. Continious data

2. Qualitative data
a. Nominal data		b. Ordinal data
==========================================


1. Quantitive data
->it answers the key quwstions such as 'how many', 'how much' and 'how often'
->quantitive data can be expressed as a number or can be quantified
->simply, it can be measured by numericcal values
->they are easy to handle for statistical manipulation
eg. Scores on test, shoe size, temperature of room, weight of a perso or subject

a. Discrete data
->Discrete data is a count that invloves only integers or we can discrete values(cannot be subdivide into parts)
eg. the number of childerns in a class - you can count whole class as individuals but can't count 1.5 childerns.

b. Continious data
->Continious data is information that could be meanigfully divide into finer levels
->it can be measured on a scale.
->can have every possible numeric value.
eg. you can measure your height at very precise scales- meters, centimeters, milimeters etc.



2. Qualitative data
->Qualitative data answer questions such as 'how this happend' or and 'why this happend'.
->Qualitative data can't be expressed as a number and can't be measured.
->it contains words, pictures and symbols but not numbers.
->it is also called categorial data because the information can be sorted by category.
eg. colour of the sea, your favorite holiday destination, your name, name of a country or entity.

a. Nominal data
->the name 'nominal' comes from latin word 'nomen' which means 'name' Nominal data is just used for labeling variables.
->it has no order just giving a name to thing/entity.
->it can be called as labels.
eg. Gender - Women, Men
	Hair colour - blonde, brown, black, white, bruntte etc.
	Marital status - single, married, widowed etc.
	
b. Ordinal data
->Oridinal has some kind of order by their position on a scale.
->you cannot do arithimatic operations with oridinal numbers.
->Oridinal variables are considered as in between qualitative and quantative vaiables.
->it can contain numbers(this is why it can place outside the qualitative data category).
->simply, Oridinal data is a qualitative data for which values are ordered.
eg. the first, second and third person in competition.
	letter grades a,b,c etc.
	economic status - low, midium and high.
