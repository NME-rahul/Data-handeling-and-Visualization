### Dimension reduction with principal component analysis- 
Dimension reduction technique is used to perform the dataset consists of multiple correlated variables that convey overlapping information. Such dataset can be reduced to smaller dataset without loss of much critical information.
For example, a dataset consist of multiple physical traits of people, including quantities such as each personâ€™s height and weight, the length of arms and legs, the circumferences of waist, hip, and chest etc.

PCA - it introduces a new set of variables called principal components by linear combination of the original variables in the data, standardized to zero mean and unit variance. PCs are chosen such that they are uncorrelated and they are ordered such that the first component captures the largest possible amount of variation in the data and subsequent component capture increasingly less.
